# Stacks Blockchain Penetration Testing Framework

This framework provides a set of tools for penetration testing and security analysis of smart contracts and networks on the Stacks blockchain. It allows developers and security researchers to identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues in Stacks-based applications and infrastructure.

## Features

- Smart contract vulnerability scanning
  - Reentrancy detection
  - Integer overflow checks
- Network security analysis
  - Node version checks
  - Peer connection analysis
  - Open port scanning
- Comprehensive security report generation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stacks-pentest-framework.git
   cd stacks-pentest-framework
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up configuration:
   - Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json`
   - Edit `config.json` with your specific settings

## Usage

Basic usage of the framework:

```python
from stacks_pentester import StacksPenTester

# Initialize the pentester
pentest = StacksPenTester(network="testnet")

# Test a specific contract
contract_address = "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM"
vulnerabilities = pentest.test_smart_contract_vulnerabilities(contract_address)

# Generate and save report
report = pentest.generate_report()
with open('security_report.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(report, f, indent=4)
```

## Configuration

The `config.json` file should contain the following structure:

```json
{
  "rpc_endpoint": "http://localhost:20443",
  "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
  "contract_addresses": [
    "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM",
    "ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG"
  ]
}
```
